    "## Goal\n",
    "The focus of this project is to dynamically generate the safest possible portfolio given a file of unknown stock tickers. With a given list of stocks, the robo advisor will generate a portfolio valued at $750,000, which is composed of a minimum of 10 and maximum of 22 stocks. This portfolio will then be run from November 25, 2023 to December 4, 2023. Ultimately, the goal is to have the portfolio deviate as little as possible from the starting value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our goal will be to tell a convincing story to WHY we are picking our stocks. We will calculate and discuss statistics, display and intepret graphs, and explain our thought process. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "Our robo advisor is designed to process the list of stock and select desirable candidates through the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing strategies, we will define some variables and constants that that will be used in later parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter Stock Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to selecting candidates for a portfolio, we filter the stock data to eliminate stocks that do not satisfy our requirements or may have been delisted. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select Candidates of Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will calculate certain measures, including but not limited to standard deviation of expected return, beta value. We will then select candidates that possess these desirable traits. To ensure a low and stable expected return, some example of these desired traits include low beta value, low standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select Optimal Weightings\n",
    "\n",
    "Since stocks with a high weighting can have a more prominent effect the overall performance of a portfolio, it is crucial for stocks in the portfolio to be weighted. We will aim to achieve optimal performance by weighting the stocks in a portfolio in a way that allows for lowest deviation in portfolio value. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Choose the Final Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the best possible bundle of stocks are chosen, the robo advisor will create multiple portfolios based on different metrics, such as lowest standard deviation, lowest expected return. After obtaining the stocks and weighting of each portfolio, we optimize for the lowest standard deviation and lowest expected return to choose a final portfolio. "

    "## Introduction\n",
    "> \"Theory will only take you so far.\" - J. Robert Oppenheimer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, throughout the many years of educations, students are taught about theory --- whether it be game theory, psychoanalytic theory. These theories are often abstract and based on various assumptions. For example, in finance, we are taught to assume that people behave rationally and with the goal to increase financial position. That is, people will not make impulse purchases; they will buy and sell stocks with the goal of earning money. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real life, there are much more complications to a situation than we assume. Therefore, more people are resorting to examining hard, cold data that does not lie. Proposed in 1952 by Harry Markowitz, the Modern Portfolio Theory is an example of such. It is a mathematical framework used to build portfolios that maximizes returns while keeping the risk below a certain level. Under this method, \n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes the Modern Portfolio Theory as an underlying framework to build a robo advisor. The robo advisor will then perform analysis and make selections to come up with a final portfolio that meets the criteria of a \"safe\" portfolio. A \"safe\" portfolio is one that deviates as little as possible from the starting value. Moreover, it is our focus to keep the difference between the initial and final value as little as possible over a short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diversification is a risk management strategy that focuses on mixing a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Hence, we plan to create 3 sets of 22 stocks in order to maximize diversification and reduce portfolio risk, but may adjust the number of stocks based on the list of stock given as well as the statistics of these stocks. For example, the robo advisor may choose to have less than 22 stocks in a portfolio in case the vast majority of stocks have an extremely high beta values. "
