    "## Goal\n",
    "The focus of this project is to dynamically generate the safest possible portfolio given a file of unknown stock tickers. With a given list of stocks, the robo advisor will generate a portfolio valued at $750,000, which is composed of a minimum of 10 and maximum of 22 stocks. This portfolio will then be run from November 25, 2023 to December 4, 2023. Ultimately, the goal is to have the portfolio deviate as little as possible from the starting value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our goal will be to tell a convincing story to WHY we are picking our stocks. We will calculate and discuss statistics, display and intepret graphs, and explain our thought process. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "Our robo advisor is designed to process the list of stock and select desirable candidates through the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing strategies, we will define some variables and constants that that will be used in later parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter Stock Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to selecting candidates for a portfolio, we filter the stock data to eliminate stocks that do not satisfy our requirements or may have been delisted. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select Candidates of Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will calculate certain measures, including but not limited to standard deviation of expected return, beta value. We will then select candidates that possess these desirable traits. To ensure a low and stable expected return, some example of these desired traits include low beta value, low standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select Optimal Weightings\n",
    "\n",
    "Since stocks with a high weighting can have a more prominent effect the overall performance of a portfolio, it is crucial for stocks in the portfolio to be weighted. We will aim to achieve optimal performance by weighting the stocks in a portfolio in a way that allows for lowest deviation in portfolio value. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Choose the Final Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the best possible bundle of stocks are chosen, the robo advisor will create multiple portfolios based on different metrics, such as lowest standard deviation, lowest expected return. After obtaining the stocks and weighting of each portfolio, we optimize for the lowest standard deviation and lowest expected return to choose a final portfolio. "

    "## Introduction\n",
    "> \"Theory will only take you so far.\" - J. Robert Oppenheimer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, throughout the many years of educations, students are taught about theory --- whether it be game theory, psychoanalytic theory. These theories are often abstract and based on various assumptions. For example, in finance, we are taught to assume that people behave rationally and with the goal to increase financial position. That is, people will not make impulse purchases; they will buy and sell stocks with the goal of earning money. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real life, there are much more complications to a situation than we assume. Therefore, more people are resorting to examining hard, cold data that does not lie. Proposed in 1952 by Harry Markowitz, the Modern Portfolio Theory is an example of such. It is a mathematical framework used to build portfolios that maximizes returns while keeping the risk below a certain level. Under this method, \n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes the Modern Portfolio Theory as an underlying framework to build a robo advisor. The robo advisor will then perform analysis and make selections to come up with a final portfolio that meets the criteria of a \"safe\" portfolio. A \"safe\" portfolio is one that deviates as little as possible from the starting value. Moreover, it is our focus to keep the difference between the initial and final value as little as possible over a short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diversification is a risk management strategy that focuses on mixing a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Hence, we plan to create 3 sets of 22 stocks in order to maximize diversification and reduce portfolio risk, but may adjust the number of stocks based on the list of stock given as well as the statistics of these stocks. For example, the robo advisor may choose to have less than 22 stocks in a portfolio in case the vast majority of stocks have an extremely high beta values. "

    "\n",
    "- Include stocks that have an average monthly volume of at leaest 150,000 shares based on Jan 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023 (drop any months that don't have at least 18 trading days)\n",

We then recursively use the function called filter_volume to to determine if the stock meets the trading volume requirement. The short months with less than 18 trading days that we obtain from the get_short_months function are dropped before we perform the calculation to determine the average monthly volume. \n",

    "Standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean with its formula given below, where $x_{i}$ is a single data point, $\\overline{X}$ is the mean of the data points and $N$ is the number of data points in a given dataset: \n",

    "We use this measure to create one of our portfolios by extracting 22 stocks with the lowest standard deviation of expected return. Since low standard deviation indicates a smaller spread relative to the mean, which is the expected return in our case, we know that the stock is more predictable. Therefore, a portfolio composed of these stocks will be more likely to succeed since the future movements of the stocks are more likely to be able to be predicted by our statistics. "

    "The formula of beta value of a stock relative to the market is as follows, where  ${Cov(r_i,r_m)}$  is the covariance between the stock and the market index,  ${Var(r_m)}$  is the variance of the market index: \n",

    "\n",
    "The S&P 500 is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of the largest companies listed on the US stock exchange. Because of the sizes of these companies as well as the diversity of the companies on the S&P 500, this index is a reasonably accurate representation of the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are choosing to go safe with our portfolio, stocks need to be chosen so as to obtain as low of a beta value as possible. Moreover, as a volatile stock may lead to capital gains/losses, we look for the lowest magnitude beta values by taking the absolute value. The aim of this part is to use beta value as a statistical measure to quantify our various portfolios which will allow us to choose the appropriate set of stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This measure is used to create our second portfolio candidate, which is either composed of the 22 stocks with the lowest beta values if all of these values are less than one, or a minimum of 10 stocks with beta values less than one. We make this choice because a beta value greater than one indicates greater volatility than the market. Although it is important to hold a diversified portfolio, we do not want to take on more volatile stocks that could make the portfolio more risky. "
